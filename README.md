# Automated Plant Watering System

This project is based on the DFRobot project to Automate Plant Watering using their sensors. ["https://github.com/DFRobot/Waterplantsystem"]
This project pairs the Raspberry Pi with the Arduino Expansion Shield, and used sensors to detect change in moisture, temperture, and light changes in the surrounding.
The information is collected and sent to Microsoft Azure's Iot Hub and then gets displayed through PowerBI.
